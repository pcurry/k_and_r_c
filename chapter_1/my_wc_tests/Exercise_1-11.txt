I would test the word count program by preparing files with known
numbers of characters, words, and lines.  I would then programatically
run my_wc with those files as input, capture the output, and compare
that to the filename, which would encode the expected output.

Inputs that would uncover errors would include boundary conditions.
So, an empty file should count 0 0 0.  Files including just newlines
should have the same number of characters as lines.  Files with one
word per line should count as such.  A file with one huge word should
count correctly.
